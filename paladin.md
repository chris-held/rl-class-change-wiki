# Paladin

Paladins take their adventures seriously, and even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test - an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to learn tactics, and to do good in the world. Divine power protects these warriors of virtue, warding off harm, protecting them from disease, healing them and their allies, and guarding against fear. Divine power also guides their sword arms, making them among the most effective warriors against undead and evil outsiders. Many of the paladin's special abilities also benefit from a high Charisma score.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 4th-level spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom of 14.
