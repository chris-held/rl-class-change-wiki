# Druid

Druids are divine spellcasters who receive their spells from nature, not the gods. They strive to live in harmony with the natural world, and hate anything that is not part of the natural cycle, especially aberrations and undead creatures. As they gain experience, they learn to take the shapes of animals and eventually of more powerful creatures. The strict oaths taken by every druid prohibit using weapons and armor outside their tradition.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 9th-level spell, a druid must have a Wisdom of 19.

- Alignment Restrictions: Must be neutral good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.
- Base Attack Bonus: +3 / 4 Levels.
- Hit Die: d8.
- Primary Saving Throws: Fortitude, Will.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with druidic weapons, as well as light and medium armor and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Divine (Wisdom-based, armor-related chance of spell failure is ignored).
- Ex-Druids: A druid who is no longer neutral cannot gain levels.
