# Blackguard

(PRESTIGE CLASS)
A Blackguard epitomizes evil. They are nothing short of a mortal fiend, a black knight with the foulest sort of reputation. Many refer to Blackguards as anti-paladins due to their completely evil nature. No one class makes the best Blackguard, all that is required is a willingness to treat with the denizens of the lower planes and act out their dark designs.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's level. For example, to cast a 4th-level spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom of 14.
